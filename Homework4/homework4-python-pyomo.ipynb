    "The problem is formulated as in class: Let $S = \\{1, 2, \\dots, n_s\\}$ be the set of shapes to jointly minimize distance from. For each shape $i \\in S$, define variable point $(x_i,y_i)$ within the shape and simply constrain $(x_i,y_i)$ to be within the shape. Since every shape presented in the problem is convex, these constraints are convex. Next, define the centerpoint $(x_0,y_0)$. We want to minimize the sum of distances $w_i = \\sqrt{(x_0-x_i)^2 + (y_0-y_i)^2}$. However, since each distance is minimized in the objective, the non-convex equality constraints become unnecessary, as it is sufficient to bound $w_i$ from below. Doing this, and squaring both sides, we obtain the convex SOCP constraint $w_i \\ge \\sqrt{(x_0-x_i)^2 + (y_0-y_i)^2} = \\|(x_0-x_i,y_0-y_i)\\|_2$ .  Now, to define the presented shapes in a generic way, let $C \\subset S$ be the set of circles, with centers $(a_i,b_i)$ and radii $r_i$ for shape $i \\in C$, and let $R \\subset S$ be the set of rectangles, with bounding boxes defined by $[x^l_i,x^u_i] \\times [y^l_i,y^u_i]$ for shape $i \\in R$. The problem is then modeled as:\n",
